Simple DB interface for one little anime shop on Django with print page content function.           
Runs on Windows in default browser with the file startServerAnikans.bat

I propose to use administration only for creating new products,            
and their quantity will be taken into account in the cash balanse.

You can contribute money by purchasing and withdraw it by selling it.           
Money is the item with barcode "0000000000000".           
If you deleted it, create a new one.           
You can use this http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/


Launch resetPassword.bat to set password for "admin" as "admin"
