Example of a simple DB interface on Django with print page content function, 
launched on Windows in default browser with the file startServerAnikans.bat

DEBUG = False in settings.py
resetPassword.bat file set password for "admin" as "admin"

I propose to use administration only for creating new products, 
and their quantity will be taken into account in the cash balanse.

You can contribute money by purchasing and withdraw it by selling it.
Money is the item with barcode "0000000000000".
If you deleted it, create a new one.
